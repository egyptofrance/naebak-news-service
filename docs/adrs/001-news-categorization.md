# ADR-001: News Categorization and Tagging Strategy

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**

The Naebak News Service requires a robust system for organizing and classifying news content. Users need to be able to easily find news relevant to their interests, and administrators need a way to manage and feature content effectively. We considered several approaches, including a simple category-based system, a flat tagging system, and a hierarchical system.

**Decision:**

We have decided to implement a hybrid approach that combines a primary, single-category system with a flexible, multi-tagging system. This will be implemented through the `NewsCategory` and `NewsTag` models.

*   **`NewsCategory`**: Each news item will belong to one primary category. Categories are predefined by administrators and are used for broad classification of content (e.g., "Politics", "Economy", "Technology"). This provides a structured and consistent way to browse news.

*   **`NewsTag`**: News items can have multiple tags. Tags are more flexible and can be created by administrators or editors to describe the specific topics covered in a news item (e.g., "elections", "parliament", "inflation"). This allows for more granular and user-driven content discovery.

**Consequences:**

**Positive:**

*   **Structured Browsing:** The category system provides a clear and structured way for users to browse news content.
*   **Flexible Discovery:** The tagging system allows for more flexible and granular content discovery, as users can search for specific topics or keywords.
*   **Administrative Control:** Administrators have control over the primary categories, ensuring consistency and quality.
*   **Scalability:** The system is scalable and can accommodate a large number of news items and topics.

**Negative:**

*   **Tag Management:** The tagging system can become cluttered or inconsistent if not managed properly. We will need to implement tools for tag management, such as merging duplicate tags and removing unused tags.
*   **User Confusion:** The distinction between categories and tags may not be immediately clear to all users. We will need to provide clear user interface cues to guide users.
